#  Acquisition History of Infosec Learning**

**I. Executive Summary**

This report aims to clarify the acquisition history of Infosec Learning and address the user's query regarding a potential prior connection or acquisition by Cengage before its acquisition by ACI Learning. Based on the analysis of the provided research material, it has been determined that the user's concern likely stems from a confusion between two similarly named entities: Infosec Learning and Infosec Institute. Infosec Institute was acquired by Cengage Group in March 2022, while Infosec Learning was acquired by ACI Learning in December 2023\. The initial analysis of the available information indicates no evidence of a prior acquisition or ownership of Infosec Learning by Cengage. To further verify the historical profile of Infosec Learning before its acquisition by ACI Learning, the Wayback Machine could serve as a valuable resource.

**II. Introduction**

The landscape of cybersecurity education is experiencing substantial growth, driven by the ever-increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber threats faced by organizations across all sectors. Within this dynamic environment, companies specializing in cybersecurity training play a crucial role in equipping individuals and organizations with the necessary skills to defend against these threats. Tracking the evolution of these companies, particularly through mergers and acquisitions, is essential for understanding market trends, competitive dynamics, and the strategic direction of key players. This report addresses a specific query concerning the acquisition history of Infosec Learning. The user has expressed a concern about a potential mix-up in the reported acquisitions, suggesting that Infosec Learning might have been acquired by Cengage before its acquisition by ACI Learning. The objective of this report is to analyze the provided research material to establish a definitive timeline of Infosec Learning's acquisitions, clarify any potential connections with Cengage, and assess the validity of the user's suspicion.

**III. Infosec Learning: Company Profile Before Acquisitions**

Infosec Learning operated as a provider of cyber security and information assurance training and skill assessment services.1 Its core business model revolved around delivering hands-on, personalized learning experiences through the use of virtual labs and cyber ranges.1 The company's solutions were designed to cater to a diverse clientele, including colleges, universities, businesses, and government entities.1

A key aspect of Infosec Learning's offering was its customizable course platform, which featured a substantial library of over 200 readily available labs.1 This platform also provided the flexibility for users to host their own labs or leverage Infosec Learning's services to create custom labs tailored to specific training objectives.1 The underlying technology was built on a scalable and user-friendly cloud-based infrastructure, utilizing HTML5 to ensure accessibility without the need for additional plugins.1

Infosec Learning emphasized the practical application of its training, aligning its curriculum with real-world scenarios and mapping it to various industry certifications.1 This focus on workforce readiness aimed to equip learners with immediately applicable skills, enhancing their career prospects.1 The company offered tailored solutions for different segments of the market. For businesses and government organizations, Infosec Learning provided talent assessment tools and customizable training programs.1 For the education sector, the platform offered seamless integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) through LTI, as well as automated lab grading functionalities.1 Testimonials from faculty members and administrators indicated positive outcomes, with reported improvements in student preparedness, success rates, the ability to work independently, and increased job opportunities following the training.1

Infosec Learning was founded in 2011 by Jim Kowatch, who served as the Founder & CEO of the company.7 Under his leadership, the company appeared to have a strong focus on the education sector, offering specialized features and integrations designed to meet the needs of colleges and universities.1 This emphasis on providing practical, hands-on cybersecurity training within an educational context likely positioned Infosec Learning as a valuable asset in the cybersecurity education market. The focus on virtual labs and real-world scenarios addressed a growing need for experiential learning in this field, making it an attractive acquisition target for companies seeking to enhance their training portfolios.

**IV. The Acquisition by Cengage Group (Infosec Institute)**

It is crucial to distinguish Infosec Learning from another company with a similar name, Infosec Institute. Infosec Institute was acquired by Cengage Group, a global education technology company, in a transaction announced on January 31, 2022, and completed on March 1, 2022\.8 The acquisition price for Infosec Institute was approximately $191 million, signifying a substantial investment by Cengage Group to expand its presence in the cybersecurity training market.8

Cengage Group's strategic rationale behind this acquisition was to enter and expand within the cybersecurity professional training market, which was experiencing significant growth due to the increasing demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals.8 Infosec Institute became part of Cengage Group's ed2go business, which operates within its Workforce Skills division, indicating an integration of Infosec Institute's offerings into Cengage's existing online learning platform.8

Infosec Institute's primary offerings included certification-based training courses specifically designed for security professionals, as well as enterprise-grade security awareness and phishing training programs for businesses, agencies, and technology professionals.8 Infosec Institute was founded in 2004 by Jack Koziol.8 The fact that Infosec Institute was founded earlier and by a different individual (Jack Koziol) than Infosec Learning (founded by Jim Kowatch in 2011\) underscores that these were two separate entities operating in the cybersecurity education space. The similarity in their names is the likely source of the user's potential confusion. Cengage's acquisition of Infosec Institute was a strategic move to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for cybersecurity education and to strengthen its position in the workforce skills sector. The significant investment made by Cengage highlights the perceived value and growth potential of the cybersecurity training market.

**V. The Acquisition by ACI Learning (Infosec Learning)**

The company that is the focus of the user's query, Infosec Learning, was acquired by ACI Learning, a provider of audit, cybersecurity, and IT training, in a transaction announced on December 6, 2023\.2 The financial terms of this acquisition were not explicitly disclosed in the provided research material.27

ACI Learning's rationale for acquiring Infosec Learning was to further consolidate its position in the audit, cybersecurity, and IT training market and to enhance its training platform with Infosec Learning's specialized digital skills learning platform, particularly its cyber ranges and virtual labs.2 At the time of the acquisition, Infosec Learning's assets included a substantial library of over 500 configurable labs, equipped with simulation, assessment, and reporting capabilities, demonstrating the technological value that ACI Learning sought.2

Jim Kowatch remained the president & CEO of Infosec Learning during the acquisition process.3 He had previously emphasized the company's strategic focus on offering its training in a cloud-based, subscription learning environment, which aligned with the evolving preferences of both individual learners and organizations.3 Tyton Partners acted as the financial advisor to Infosec Learning in this transaction.2 This acquisition by ACI Learning signifies a continuing trend of consolidation within the cybersecurity and IT training market, as companies aim to create more comprehensive and integrated training solutions. Infosec Learning's emphasis on cloud-based virtual labs and its established presence in the education sector made it a strategic fit for ACI Learning's growth objectives.

**VI. Investigating a Prior Link Between Infosec Learning and Cengage**

The timeline of the acquisitions clearly indicates two separate events. Cengage acquired Infosec Institute in March 2022 8, while ACI Learning acquired Infosec Learning in December 2023\.2 A thorough review of all the provided research snippets reveals no evidence of Cengage having acquired or owned Infosec Learning at any point before December 2023\.

The snippets related to Cengage consistently discuss the acquisition of Infosec Institute, founded by Jack Koziol in 2004\.8 Conversely, the snippets concerning ACI Learning consistently discuss the acquisition of Infosec Learning, founded by Jim Kowatch in 2011\.2

Notably, a snippet from March 2023 34 mentions a partnership involving By Light, CompTIA, and Infosec Learning, occurring after Cengage's acquisition of Infosec Institute but before ACI Learning's acquisition of Infosec Learning. This indicates that Infosec Learning was operating independently during this period and does not mention any connection with Cengage. Additionally, a Reddit post from December 2023 26 refers to the lab portal of Infosec Learning, again just before its acquisition by ACI Learning, with no mention of Cengage. Several other snippets from before the ACI Learning acquisition feature Jim Kowatch as CEO of Infosec Learning without any reference to Cengage.6 Furthermore, company profile information on platforms like Tracxn 11 explicitly states Jim Kowatch as the founder of Infosec Learning and its acquisition by ACI Learning, without any indication of prior Cengage ownership. Infosec Learning's own "About Us" page 14 also reinforces Jim Kowatch's role as Founder & CEO, further suggesting its independent operation before the ACI Learning acquisition.

The evidence strongly suggests that Infosec Learning and Infosec Institute were distinct entities. The user's perception of a mix-up likely stems from the similarity in the company names. The different founding years, founders, and ultimate acquirers clearly delineate their separate histories.

**VII. The Role of the Wayback Machine**

The Wayback Machine functions as a comprehensive internet archive, allowing users to access historical snapshots of websites.35 In the context of this investigation, exploring archived versions of infoseclearning.com from before December 2023 could provide further valuable insights into the company's profile and potentially address the user's query more directly.

By examining historical snapshots, it might be possible to gain access to the company's "About Us" page, team information, and any details regarding ownership or partnerships that were publicly available before the ACI Learning acquisition.11 This could help verify the company's branding, mission statement, and whether there were any mentions of affiliations with Cengage prior to December 2023\. Additionally, the Wayback Machine could offer a clearer understanding of the specific services and focus areas of Infosec Learning before its acquisition by ACI Learning.1 While the current analysis of news articles and press releases does not support the user's suspicion of a prior Cengage acquisition of Infosec Learning, the Wayback Machine could serve as an additional layer of verification by providing a direct look at the company's own historical online presence.

**VIII. Conclusion**

In conclusion, the analysis of the provided research material indicates that the user's concern about a mix-up in the acquisition history is likely due to the similarity in names between Infosec Learning and Infosec Institute. Cengage Group acquired Infosec Institute in March 2022, while ACI Learning acquired Infosec Learning in December 2023\. These were two separate transactions involving distinct companies. Based on the available evidence, there is no indication that Cengage acquired or had any ownership stake in Infosec Learning before its acquisition by ACI Learning. It is essential to differentiate between Infosec Learning, founded by Jim Kowatch in 2011 and focused on virtual labs and cyber ranges, and Infosec Institute, founded by Jack Koziol in 2004 and specializing in certification and security awareness training.

**IX. Recommendations**

To further investigate the historical profile of Infosec Learning and provide additional clarity, it is strongly recommended to utilize the Wayback Machine to archive and analyze snapshots of infoseclearning.com from the period before December 2023\. This would allow for a direct examination of the company's website content over time, potentially revealing details about its history, ownership, and any affiliations. Additionally, cross-referencing the acquisition timelines and company information with reputable business and financial data sources is advisable to ensure accuracy and identify any further relevant information. If necessary, reaching out to representatives of ACI Learning or former representatives of Infosec Learning could provide direct clarification on their acquisition history.
