## VMware, vSphere & Virtualization Overview

This document supports the AI assistant in explaining core infrastructure topics relevant to building and deploying virtualized lab environments.

### ðŸ”¹ Virtualization

- **Definition**: Virtualization is the process of running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host using a hypervisor.
- **Benefits**:
  - Increased hardware utilization
  - Isolated environments for testing and training
  - Easier disaster recovery and snapshots
  - Efficient lab replication and reset

### ðŸ”¹ VMware Platform Overview

- **VMware**: Industry-leading provider of virtualization software.
- **Key Components**:
  - **ESXi**: Bare-metal hypervisor installed directly on physical servers.
  - **vCenter Server**: Centralized management platform for ESXi hosts and virtual machines.
  - **vSphere**: Comprehensive suite for managing and automating VMware environments, including ESXi and vCenter.

### ðŸ”¹ vSphere Lab Use Cases

- VLAN isolation for each lab environment
- Support for non-persistent labs using instant clones
- Snapshot and revert capability for exercises
- Nested virtualization for running software like GNS3 or EVE-NG
- Compatibility with Windows, Linux, and firewall appliances

### ðŸ”¹ Common Terms

- **Instant Clone**: A VMware technology allowing rapid creation of new VMs from a running parent VM.
- **Snapshot**: Captures the current state of a VM to allow rollback.
- **Nested Virtualization**: Running hypervisors inside VMsâ€”used in advanced networking or emulation scenarios.
